# MEMIP-case

Matrix-based ensembled models inter-comparison platform (MEMIP) deployed in CIESM [1]. \

MEMIP is designed to incorporate the matrix approach [2] into an earth system model to facilitate the understanding of ensemble uncertainty between the land C states and fluxes predicted by different models. \ 

Currently there are five soil biogeochemistry schemes, derived from the CENTURY [3], BIOME-BGC [4], LPJ [5], JULES [6] and CABLE [7] models, and a vertical resolved soil organic material distribution scheme [8] being coupled with CIESM-LAND, the land conponent of CIESM. \
